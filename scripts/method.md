## Setup and Initialization

```julia
for layer in layers
```
- Starts a loop over different neural network layer configurations.

```julia
prefix = "a0hnp_"
```
- Sets a prefix for output file names.
- Helps organize files from different runs or experiments.

```julia
hp_file = "a0_single_swimmer_thetas_0_10_h_0.0_0.25_fs_0.2_0.4_h_p.jls"
hp_coeff = "a0_single_swimmer_coeffs_thetas_0_10_h_0.0_0.25_fs_0.2_0.4_h_p.jls"
```
- Specifies filenames for input data and coefficients.
- Contains simulation data for a single swimmer with various parameters.

```julia
mp = ModelParams(layer, 0.001, 1000, 4096, errorL2, gpu)
```
- Creates a `ModelParams` object with hyperparameters:
  - `layer`: Current layer configuration
  - `0.001`: Learning rate
  - `1000`: Number of epochs
  - `4096`: Batch size
  - `errorL2`: Loss function
  - `gpu`: Indicates GPU usage

```julia
bAE, μAE, convNN, perfNN = build_networks(mp)
```
- Builds neural network architectures based on model parameters:
  - `bAE`: Autoencoder for forcing function
  - `μAE`: Autoencoder for result of linear solve
  - `convNN`: Convolutional neural network to process **images**
  - `perfNN`: Network for predicting performance metrics

```julia
μstate, bstate, convNNstate, perfNNstate = build_states(mp, bAE, μAE, convNN, perfNN)
```
- Creates initial states for each neural network.
- States include current network parameters and optimizer state.

```julia
dataloader, motions = build_dataloaders(mp; data_file=hp_file, coeffs_file=hp_coeff)
```
- Loads data from specified files.
- Creates a DataLoader for efficient data feeding during training.
- Returns `motions` object with swimmer movement information.
